- After packaging the Storybook project, navigate to your local project where you want to install the library.
- Install the packaged library locally using one of the following methods:
- Run `npm install ../my-path-to/academy-react-storybook.tgz` if you have the `.tgz` file locally.
- Alternatively, utilize npm link to directly link the local library.

- Once the installation is complete, verify that the library is successfully installed and accessible within your project.
- Explore the components and stories provided by the Storybook library.
- Test the components in your local project to ensure they function as expected.
