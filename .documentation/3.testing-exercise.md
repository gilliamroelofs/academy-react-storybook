# Testing exercise

Scan through the test files to see multiple examples of testing approaches. For example, take a look at the hook `useFocusTrap`. It uses mocking to manage the dependency to focus-trap. We don't want to pollute the test with the complexity of its implementation. Or check out Typography or Grid to see some unit testing with @testing-library/react.

## Tips

- You can test each component isolated by mocking its dependencies with the use of `jest.mock` and `jest.mocked`.
- A React component is a function, every function can be asserted by how many times its called and what the parameters were when it was called.
- Render the complete component and query the Jest DOM using [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/)
- you can use `userEvent` to simulate user interactions and assert that an accordion item opens when clicked.

### Instructions

- Choose either your own created Accordion component or use the Card component provided.
- Create an [ComponentName].test.tsx files for each component files And unit test according to approach 1.
- Create an [ComponentName].test.tsx file and test according to approach 2.
