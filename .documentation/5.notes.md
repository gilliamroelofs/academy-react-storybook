# Notes

## State management

In a large SPA, state management can get quite critical. To ensure a scalable application you could opt for Redux toolkit.

Notes:

- When deciding on a state management solution, consider the complexity and size of your application. For smaller applications, React's built-in hooks like `useState` and `useReducer` might suffice, while larger applications may benefit from the predictability and centralized state management offered by Redux.
- Redux toolkit provides a comprehensive solution for managing complex application state, including features like Redux DevTools integration and simplified configuration with createSlice.
- Keep in mind that while Redux is powerful, it also introduces additional boilerplate and complexity to your codebase. Evaluate whether the benefits outweigh the overhead for your specific project requirements.

## Testing

Testing is an integral part of building robust and reliable React applications. This project uses `jest` but depending on your needs or setup you could for example also opt for `vitest`.

Notes:

- Write tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation details. This will make your tests more resilient to changes in your codebase and provide better coverage of your application's functionality.
- Use mocking to isolate components and simulate dependencies. This allows you to test components in isolation and avoid side effects from affecting your tests.
- Take advantage of Jest's snapshot testing feature to quickly identify visual regressions in your components. Snapshots capture the output of your components and can be compared against future changes to ensure consistency.
- Incorporate userEvent from React Testing Library to simulate user interactions in your tests. This helps ensure that your components respond correctly to user input and interactions.

## Component Composition

Component composition is a fundamental concept in React development, allowing you to build complex UIs from simple, reusable components.

Notes:

- Break down your UI into smaller, reusable components that each handle a single responsibility. This makes your components easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- Use composition patterns like render props, higher-order components, and React hooks to share functionality between components without introducing unnecessary coupling.
- Embrace React's declarative nature by designing your components to be composable and flexible. This allows you to build UIs that are easy to reason about and modify as your application grows.
