# Weather Widget Exercise

Now you have seen all these examples, try to create and design from scatch :)

Create a weather widget that displays the weather forecast for the next 12 hours based on the user's location. The widget should consist of small UI components, a service function to fetch data from the API, a feature hook to handle state and data fetching, and a feature widget component composed with its atomic/molecular components.

Learning goals:

- Understanding component composition in React.
- Practicing data fetching from an external API.
- Implementing state management with hooks like useReducer and useContext.
- Reinforcing knowledge of React's lifecycle methods.
- Creativity and open-ended design exploration.

1. Create UI Components: Develop small UI components (e.g., WeatherIcon, TemperatureDisplay, TimeDisplay) to compose the weather widget.
2. Service Function: Implement a pure service function to fetch weather data from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs).
3. Feature Hook: Create a feature hook that manages the state and connection to the service function. Utilize useReducer and useContext to manage state efficiently.
4. Feature Widget Component: Develop the feature widget component that fetches weather data on mount and composes it with the atomic/molecular UI components.
5. Extra Features (Optional):
    - Allow users to configure parameters via form input (e.g., location, temperature units).
    - Implement state management using useReducer and useContext to handle widget state.

> Feel free to explore different designs for your weather widget. You can search for example images online or come up with your own creative layout. The goal is apply the lessons learned from this evening.

Extra's:

- let user configure parameters by form input
- use `useReducer` and `useContext` to manage the state of the feature component
